* This circuit remain unaffected by **VDD** *(4-5-8(b): Vgs will always be same as long as I1=I2)*
* By adjusting R(below M2), Vgs will be changed. Thus I6 can be adjusted.
* The part from the far left is a start up circuit, which is necessary



### Current Mirror

* If Vdd change, M1 will help to hold Vsg of M3
* One can cal dIO/dvdd by starting from Vdd = vsg3+vgs1
