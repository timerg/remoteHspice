1. Range is still narrow: off after 1u; nonlinear below 20n
    - Have already tried increase W/L of me. But isn't effective enough.
2. output offset stage voltage need to be smaller than input by 0.2
    - Increasing I of output stage of op seems to be a proper solution. this work when i use 1.8 as op(both input and output) ref V instead of 2. The reseaon should be the impedance btw me2, 2stage Mos
